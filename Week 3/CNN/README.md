# Convolutional Neural Network

In the previous week we had learnt about Neural Networks. This week we will learn a special kind of network called Convolutional Neural Network.

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a category of machine learning model, namely a type of deep learning algorithm well suited to analysing visual data. CNNs (sometimes referred to as convnets) use principles from linear algebra, particularly convolution operations, to extract features and identify patterns within images. Although CNNs are predominantly used to process images, they can also be adapted to work with audio and other signal data.

## Architecture
Convolutional neural networks have three main kinds of layers, which are:
* Convolutional layer
* Pooling layer
* Fully-connected layer
  
To get more deeper about these layers refer to this [theory](https://medium.com/latinxinai/convolutional-neural-network-from-scratch-6b1c856e1c07).


## How does CNN work?
Before going through the application it is important to know how CNN architecture works.

To have some basic ideas go through the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfiSAzpy9NM) to get a better intuition.  
Go through the [theory](https://medium.com/thedeephub/convolutional-neural-networks-a-comprehensive-guide-5cc0b5eae175) to get some more insights.


## Maths Behind
To have a better understanding on maths behind CNN refer to any of these videos.
