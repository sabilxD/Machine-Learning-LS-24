### PROJECT 2
> This project aims to develop a benchmark for long-tailed, multi-class medical image classification, we will use the HAM10000 Dataset that was acquired with a variety of dermatoscope types that are categorized into one of seven possible disease categories.


### INSTRUCTIONS
> Go through the [instruction doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xpSxyq8pRyjPRciQb3tOjV24K7pqniHY/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=102124429604486730187&rtpof=true&sd=true) to get better understanding about the problem statement and the datasets..
> Tip- Explore various OpenCV techniques to preprocess the image well before using any model

### TYPES OF METRICES
>For scientific completeness, predicted responses will also have the following metrics computed (comparing prediction vs. ground truth) for each image:

* >>[Accuracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision#In_binary_classification)
* >>[area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic#Area_under_the_curve)
* >>[mean average precision](http://fastml.com/what-you-wanted-to-know-about-mean-average-precision/)
* >>[F1 score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score)

### SUBMISSION MODE
> Submit the github repo containing ipynb file along with normalized-multi class accuracy.
