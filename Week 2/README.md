## Welcome to Week 2
Welcome to the second week of our **Machine Learning Course!** This week, we'll dive into the world of Deep Learning. We’ll start by equipping ourselves with the most essential Deep Learning framework, TensorFlow/PyTorch, which are crucial for building and training Deep Learning models. Following this, we’ll delve into the foundational concepts of neural networks and explore the YOLOv8 architecture for object classifictaion. Additionally, we'll practice on various datasets to test our learning.

Stay engaged and practice consistently to make the most of this learning experience. Keep your enthusiasm high, and let’s continue this exciting journey of machine learning together!

1. Let's start with Deep Learning framework, [TensorFlow/PyTorch](./Framework%20+%20NN) followed by concepts of [Neural Network](./Framework%20+%20NN).
2. Now we'll cover [Classifiers](./Classifiers), which are algorithms used to classify data into different categories based on patterns in the input features.
   You can skip if it has been done in week 1. 
4. Let's explore [YOLOv8](./YOLOv8), focusing on its capabilities for object detection and classification.
5. It's time to put our knowledge to the test. Let's tackle the [Assignments](./Assignment) and practice our skills to reinforce our understanding.

**Congratulations** on completing the second week! We hope you've gained valuable insights that have sparked your enthusiasm and interest in machine learning. Next week, we'll delve into the expansive realm of CNN, a powerful approach for image related problems. Keep your enthusiasm high, and we are excited to see you in the next week.
